## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Debaraj-stha/resume-builder.git
cd resume-builder
```

### 2. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

### 3. Configure Supabase

Create a `.env` file in the root folder and add:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

Make sure your Supabase project has:

* A `resumes` table with fields like `user_id`, `template`, `content`, `last_saved`, etc.
* Row-Level Security enabled with appropriate policies
* A private storage bucket named `files`; signed URLs and owner-only storage policies are required

---

### 4. Setup and run FastAPI backend

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

* The FastAPI backend listens for resume PDF uploads
* It extracts text using `pdfplumber`
* Parses sections dynamically with regex-based dividers
* Processes text with `spaCy` for NLP parsing
* Returns structured resume sections to the frontend

---

### 5. Run the frontend app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` (or your configured port) to access the app.

## 🧪 Development Notes

* **Authentication** is handled using Supabase Auth:

  * Google OAuth via Supabase
  * Email/password sign-up and login

* **Resume Templates** are modular React components styled with styled-components

* **Form Data** is managed using React Hook Form and auto-saved to Supabase every 60 seconds

* **Resume Upload & Parsing**:

  * Users can upload a PDF resume file
  * File is sent to FastAPI backend
  * Backend uses `pdfplumber` and `spaCy` to parse text and extract sections dynamically
  * Parsed data is sent back and used to prefill or update the resume form

* **Images** (e.g., profile pictures) are uploaded to Supabase Storage and linked to the user's profile

* **PDF Export**:

  * Uses `html2canvas` to convert the resume DOM into a canvas
  * Uses `jspdf` to create downloadable A4 PDF files
  * Supports multi-page export and high-quality rendering

* **Theming** controlled via `ThemeProvider` and JSON config files for light/dark modes
